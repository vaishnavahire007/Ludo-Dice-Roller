# üé≤ Ludo Dice Roller üé≤

Welcome to the **Ludo Dice Roller**! This is a simple and fun web application designed to help you play Ludo without needing a physical dice. Just open it on your phone, tablet, or computer, and you're ready to roll!

## ‚ú® What is This Project?

This project is a digital dice roller specifically made for the classic board game, Ludo. Instead of shaking a physical dice, you just click a button, and it shows you a random number from 1 to 6, just like a real dice.

## üéØ Why Did We Build This?

We built this Ludo Dice Roller for a few simple reasons:

1.  **Convenience:** Sometimes you lose your dice, or you're playing Ludo online with friends, and you need a quick way to roll. This app solves that problem!
2.  **Fairness:** It uses a computer to generate random numbers, ensuring every roll is completely fair and unbiased.
3.  **Enhance the Experience:** It adds a modern touch to the traditional game, making it easy and fun to play anywhere.
4.  **Learning:** This project also serves as a great example of building interactive web applications using basic web technologies.
